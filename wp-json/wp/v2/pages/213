For brevity, I'm adding a placeholder for the content -->\n\n        <h2>And what did I see?<\/h2>\n\n<p>\n\n<br>\nGreetings fellow Moonbois and Moongirls, <br><br>A long time ago I uttered these words\nabout the true utility of a memecoin: <strong>it is the power of a free, decentralised,\npeer-to-peer memetic community.<\/strong>\nA decentralised social power that hearkens back to the early days of internet\nimageboards. In the last two years I have quietly observed the XRP Ledger altcoin\necosystem and mulled over my own past mistakes.\nAnd what did I see?\nWhilst tokens may be built upon a decentralised, censorship-resistant network - and\neven distributed fairly - the reality is that they become centralised socially, primarily\nby viewing certain social media accounts as the \u2018official\u2019 ones and by looking to\nsupposedly \u2018official\u2019 leaders to lead the way.\nIn the early days of XRdoge, the power of the token was the community. I\nencouraged you all to make your own Twitter\/X accounts, your own Telegram\ngroups, your own Discords. To make whatever memes, videos and artwork you\nwanted to. The unbound creativity that was unleashed was awesome. It brought a\ntear to my eye.\nThis is the power behind any successful and lasting memecoin: the\nsocially-decentralised memetic community. Not a singular centralised hub, but rather\na decentralised network, interconnected through many strong and powerful\nco-dependent hubs.\nIt is the transformation of the bridled potential memetic energy of the many into an\nunbridled and unstoppable creative memetic force.\nIn this manifesto I will talk about the problems I see in many memecoins and how the\nnew token I am launching - <strong>MB589<\/strong> - aims to fix this through its launch mechanism.\nIt will be quite unlike anything you have seen and will put right what once went\nwrong.<\/p>\n        \n        <h3>Where Memecoins Go Wrong<\/h3>\n        <p>What makes a memecoin great? In my opinion, it is not the developers, not the\n\u2018official\u2019 leaders (the kings), but rather its ability to unleash the memetic powers of a\nvast number of people; its ability to create a decentralised but interconnected web of\nmemetic cells that cannot be stopped.\n<br>\n<br>\n<strong>What makes a memecoin poor?<\/strong> When the community starts to worship its kings.<br><br>\nWhy do some view a handful of people as the project's official leaders? Solely\nbecause those people have the passwords for the two or three \u2018official\u2019 social media\naccounts, and maybe they gave themselves a tonne of tokens.\nA decentralised token becomes centralised in social belief - the unsubstantiated\nbelief that these few centralised social media accounts are the \u2018official\u2019 ones. The\nweb becomes tattered and torn, and the decentralised peer-to-peer memetic\nconnections wither and die. As the memetic power of the community wanes, they\nstart to wait for their handful of kings to do something.\nOnce the community looks to be told what they should meme about, what the project\nis doing next, and what they should think - then that is slow death of creativity and\nthus, the death of a memecoin\nSo why does a memecoin require a handful of \u2018kings\u2019 to hold vast swathes of project\nfunds? For what good? It is wholly unnecessary for a memecoin. Some might\nanswer: \u201cto get onto a centralised exchange\u201d.<\/p>\n<h3>MB589: Decentralised Memetics<\/h3>\n\n<p>Whilst MB589 will have no \u2018official\u2019 kings - that is: no one bestowed with the divine\nright to rule - inevitably, decentralised leaders will rise. In fact we want as many\npeople as possible to take on the spiritual role of Moonboi589. What emerges will be\na <strong>memocracy<\/strong>.\nThe memetic power of each Moonboi will determine how high they rise and how\nmuch influence they hold. Some will rise and some will fall, to be replaced by new\nMoonbois. We want the decentralised but interconnected network to have many\nsuch hubs and concentrations of memetic power. These will be determined by the\ninvisible hand of <strong>memocracy<\/strong>, not a divine right to rule, and not even by how many\ntokens one holds.\nSome Moonbois may form large groups to work together. Another Moonboi may\nnever join groups, but will remain content to simply meme as a lone wolf. And\nanything in between.<\/p>\n<p>The Big Bang Phase exists as a temporary centralisation to create the necessary\n<strong>Decentralised Memetic<\/strong> Network in which the power of Decentralised Memetics can\nwork and flourish. We are currently in the Great Gathering as we concentrate our\nmemetic power. Soon to follow this, we will unleash the hordes of Moonboi\nmemelords.\nXRP, with its Ledger & DEX, already covers the traditional utility. MB589 is here to\nunleash the power of Decentralised Memetics. If the community wishes, it can be\nas much about promoting XRP, XRPL, the XRPL DEX and the wider ecosystem as it\nwill be about promoting the MB589 token.\nThe essence of Decentralised Memetics is freedom. Each will be free to wield the\npower of Decentralised Memetics as they see fit.\n<br>\n<br>\n<strong>No Kings. No Devs. Only Memes.<\/strong><\/p>\n<h3>The Utility of Decentralised Memetics<\/h3>\n<p>\n    What is the utility of decentralized memetics?<br><br>\nWell, first of all, let\u2019s ask what the utility of memetics is in general. Secondly, let\u2019s\nremember that utility is just a fancy word for usefulness. So the first question is\nreally, \u201cwhat is the usefulness of memetics?\u201d.<br><br>\nWell, take a look at a dollar bill. What do you notice? It is covered in memes. The\nGreat Seal, the Federal Reserve Seal and an icon of a long dead president.\nMemetics have a power and utility that is coded into human nature, and indeed how\nthis reality functions. Language itself is memetics - one simply has to look at its origin\nin hieroglyphics or Celtic runes. Even cave paintings, if you like.<br><br>\nMankind has always found memes to be highly useful. Thus, they have utility.<br><br>\nIf we look at nature there is the phenomenon of warning colouration. It is usually\nsome combination of red, yellow, black and white. This is a biological meme. This\nmeme has spread into human memetics - just look at traffic lights and road signage.<br><br>\nOr we can look at the world of business. Banks used to have neoclassical\narchitecture projecting stability, longevity and power. Now they look like coffee shops.\nWhat changed is the memetic framework they are operating in, and they have\nadapted their memetic appearance to fit. Their change in memetics is useful, thus it\nhas utility.<br><br>\nA king sits on a throne, a businessman wears a suit, an artist may appear\nbedraggled. These are all appropriate memetic frameworks to achieve a goal. This is\nthe utility of memetics.<br><br>\nEven language itself is memetics. Every religious text, every revolutionary tract,\nevery song you hear on the radio; these are all full of powerful memetic imagery,\nsymbolism, allegories and metaphors. Their usefulness is to take an idea and\npresent it to the world.<br><br>\nHowever, there is a dark side to this. One might say that propaganda is a synonym\nfor centralised memetics and the means by which the many are manipulated by the\nfew. In 1984, the Ministry of Truth can be viewed as a centralised memetic\norganisation. One of its key memes was the image of Big Brother seen everywhere,\ninforming the populace they were being watched.<br><br>\nWithout malicious intent, most memecoins fall into centralised memetics via their\ncentralised \u2018official\u2019 social media accounts, as has been discussed earlier.<br><br>\nDecentralised Memetics is the idea of applying the same ethos of decentralisation to\nmemes, memetic communities and memecoins. Not for manipulative propaganda,\nbut for freedom. The aim is to unleash the creative spark of as many people as\npossible in an interconnected but still decentralised web.<br><br>\nThe possibilities it can bring are endless, which is the very usefulness of\nDecentralised Memetics.\n<\/p>\n<h3>MB589 Big Bang Phase: the Centre Will Not Hold<\/h3>\n<p>The Moonboi589 token <strong>(MB589)<\/strong> launch phase will be quite unlike anything you have\nseen. A handful of prime movers are motivated to put right what once went wrong,\nbut like the deist god, once the big bang phase is over, they pull back, leaving the\nfree will of the community and its multiplicity of memetic interactions to decide what\nhappens next. The prime movers will return to being just one more person in the\ncommunity - no more or less than anyone else.<br><br>\nThe Big Bang Phase has two memetic movements. A concentration of as much\nenergy as possible, followed by an almighty explosion.<br><br>\n<strong>First the gathering, then the unleashing of the hordes.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The first phase is <strong>The Great Gathering<\/strong>. The prime movers will provide temporary\ncentralised memetic spaces to concentrate the memetic power of as many Moonbois\nand memelords as possible. This will include Twitter\/X, Telegram and Discord.\nHere memetic ideas will flow, and interact and grow. Comrades will be met, and\nfriends made. Shill groups will form to spread the good word of Decentralised\nMemetics.<br><br>\nNext, we <strong>Unleash the Hordes!!!<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>The prime mover social media accounts - Twitter\/X, Telegram, Discord etc - will go\ndormant 5 weeks after the main airdrop. The Great Gathering will be complete. The\nprime movers\u2019 social media accounts only serve as a temporarily centralised hub to\nconcentrate the memetic forces as much as possible. Once their work is done, they\nwill go dark. <strong>The Hordes<\/strong> will be unleashed, and it will be up to the Decentralised\nMemetic Network to spread its tentacles ever wider.<br><br>\nThe main social media accounts will promote themselves, the airdrop and the\nmanifesto during the Big Bang phase, but its main role will be to forge the\nconnections of the Decentralised Memetic Network - to drive a multiplicity of\nindependent Moonbois, guerilla memetic cells, and a multiplicity of hubs - all\ninterconnected.<br><br>\nIf someone runs a cool MB589 Twitter\/X account, or makes an amazing video, or\nsome start a raid group - we will share and promote it. The temporary \u2018official\u2019\nTwitter\/X account will be where you go to find out who else to follow. So, by the time\nof the airdrop, the Decentralised Memetic Network will be formed. It will be that\nwhich takes the token forward.<br><br>\nAfter the initial centralised hubs go dark, the work of potential spread of the memetic\nweb is limitless, if the many free Moonbois make it so.<br><br>\n<strong>We will all become Moonboi589.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<h3>Who will do the work?<\/h3>\n<p>\n    The answer is: <strong>anyone who wants to<\/strong>. There is no expectation of profit derived from\nthe work of others. There is only an expectation of memes & fun derived from your\nmemetic work, and your interaction with the memetic work of others. There is no\nofficial centralised group to control the natural flow of memetics once the Big Bang\nPhase is over.<br><br>\nThe direction and progress of MB589 will be in the hands of anyone and everyone\nthat wants to be involved, for as long as they want to be. In short, it will be up to the\ncommunity - not in a collectivist sense, but in an anarcho-memetic sense - guided by\nthe two invisible hands of enlightened economic self-interest and decentralised\nmemetics.<br><br>\nThe collective wealth of the Moonboi589 project comprises resources available for all\nto use. That is the MB589 token, the XRP Ledger, its DEX and the XUMM wallet. It\nalso includes social media platforms like Twitter\/X, Telegram and Discord, and of\ncourse the decentralised memetic force & network that anyone can tap into. On top\nof these common resources, anyone can build their own private groups or\nenterprises.<br><br>\nMaybe MB589 will stay on the XRPL DEX\/Sologenic only. Maybe a few early\nadopters make a lot of money and want to pay to be listed on a centralised\nexchange. Maybe some will crowdsource it. It will be up to each and every Moonboi\nwhat happens, how long they want to be involved, and to what extent.<br><br>\nHolding just one MB589 token makes you part of the decentralised memetic\norganism that will be MB589, and what that means is up to you.<br><br>\nI\u2019ll give an example of this happening. I am a holder of a coin elsewhere on a very\nsmall blockchain. There are devs, but the devs don\u2019t own a large amount of coins to\npay for things, and they work in their own time. The non-dev side is driven by the\ncommunity. Community members have formed their own groups to create a new\nwebsite. They collected $2k and arranged and paid for a new CEX listing on a small,\nreasonably priced, but growing exchange. This was all done independently of the\ndevelopers. The community have created their own marketing groups and are\ncreating their own Telegram groups for formal and guerilla marketing. This they have\nall achieved without instruction from on high.<br><br>\nOff their own backs, community members learned the process of exchange listings,\nresearched which would be the best fit within a reasonable price range, and they got\nit done. This is what is possible. Instead of waiting on the developers, they have\nacted both independently and together in order to pump their own bags.<br><br>\nHow could this be achieved with MB589? I will go into more detail in a future video.<br><br>\nAgain, MB589 is not collectivism where all march to the beat of the same drum. No,\nthat requires \u201cofficial\u201d social media accounts and supposed \u2018kings\u2019 of the coin.<br><br>\nWe seek to have many private and\/or open hubs of varying concentrations of\nmemetic power interconnected to degrees that they desire - freedom of association\nand dissociation. I believe that what we can achieve is boundless.\n<br><br>\n<strong>In MB589 we meme our bags both as individuals and together as a community,\nas we each see fit.<\/strong>\n<\/p>\n\n<h3>Memes First. Fun Foremost.<\/h3>\n\nBefore we get started, the most important thing to note is that XRP is, and remains,\nthe crown jewel of the XRP Ledger.<br><br>\nThe MB589 token is not something to put your life's savings in, nor what you cannot\nafford to lose.<br><br>\nIn fact, MB589 is about Memes & Fun - first and foremost. We can have fun & meme\nif the price goes up, and we can have fun & meme if the price goes down. Building\nthe Decentralised Memetic Network, memeing and having fun are primary. Price will\njust do what it does.<br><br>\nNo one is saying you can\u2019t want and hope for the price to go up, but prices go up and\nprices can go down as well. A change of psychology is needed in order to help keep\nthe memetic energy strong during accumulation zones.<br><br>\nWhat is that change in psychology?<br><br>\nWell, as the Decentralised Memetic Network of MB589 waxes ever greater, so my\nclaims over Moonboi589 will wane ever more. <strong>Over the Big Bang period I will\ngradually relinquish the title of Moonboi589<\/strong>.<br><br>\nThis means that anyone can manifest the spirit of Moonboi589. If you just hold one\ntoken, you can be Moonboi589.<br><br>\n\nI return to the boring old bloke I always was. No more or less than any other wielder\nof the MB589 memetic force. I will not be the ruler of anyone or anything. There is no\nfear of the creators abandoning the project, because that is the whole point. I will not\nabandon you, but I will return to being just the same as any other Moonboi.<br><br>\n\nPerhaps you think it arrogant for me to name a token after myself, but to repeat: it is\nnamed after a character.<br><br>\nMoonboi589 is to become <strong>the faceless and nameless spirit of Moonboiness on\nthe XRPL and of XRP<\/strong>. This is the twin memetic symbolism of MB589. Being an\nunapologetic Moonboi, and the 589 mystique, is the memetic lore of the XRPL\nThe spirit of Moonboi589 can be used to promote MB589, or XRP, or the XRPL as a\nwhole. The ups and downs. The good and the bad.<br><br>\n\n\n\n<img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/moonboi589.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/12\/MB589-logo.png\" alt=\"Descriptive text for the image\">\n\n\n<p>The spirit of Moonboi589 can be used to promote MB589, or XRP, or the XRPL as a\nwhole.

Then if the\nprices go down for a while, there is no one else to look to but oneself for how to build\nup the necessary memetic energy during accumulation phases with which to launch\nthe next advance.<br><br>\nNo more pleading for the kings to do something, or looking to the official Twitter\/X\naccount, because there will be none.<br><br>\nYou meme your own bags, and the Decentralised Memetic Network of Moonbois\nmemes their bags independently, or together, or both! It is up to you.\n<br><br>We come to spread the good word of Decentralised Memetics and promote MB589,\nXRP and the XRP Ledger ecosystem. If we allow the price to just be what it will be,\nwe can have fun no matter what.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Star Wars and MB589<\/h3>\n<p>\n    A chap called George Lucas wrote a film called Star Wars. A space adventure based\non the existing memetic lore of the \u2018hero\u2019s journey\u2019. It got big, really big. What made\nit so? Yes, the quality of the new presentation of age-old memetic lore, but really it\nwas the fandom. The art they made, the fanzines, their own communities - all distinct\nfrom anything \u2018official\u2019.<br><br>\nGeorge Lucas is the equivalent of what the prime movers are attempting to unleash\nin the Big Bang Phase of MB589.<br><br>\nWhat happened next for Star Wars? The fans cried out for George Lucas to make\nmovies. However, whilst they waited they wrote their own stories and created\nartwork. But none of this could be considered \u201ccanon\u201d. Finally George Lucas\nreleased \u2018Episode I - the Phantom Menace.\u2019 Disappointment abounded. Some said\nthat George Lucas had killed their childhood. Years and years of the fanbase waiting\non their centralised leader to do something. When he finally did, it wasn\u2019t what they\nwanted.<br><br>\nWhat did George do next? He handed over control of Star Wars to Kathleen\nKennedy and Disney, and as the quality of Star Wars continues to diminish, the\nfandom gives up hope and moves on.<br><br>\n\nWhat if, just what if, instead of selling Star Wars to Disney, George Lucas had placed\nall of Star Wars into the public domain. What if he had done this after the original\ntrilogy, or even after the prequels. Just think of how much more the fanbase would\nhave created by freely building upon what the prime mover had done.<br><br>\nThere would have been no official canon outside of the original trilogy or even\nprequels. Anyone could write backstories and tales of an expanded universe. Who\nwould determine what is canon? Outside of the few initial movies, canon would just\nbe what each person thought for themselves. The fandom would not have become\ndisappointed & disillusioned by forever waiting for what their leaders tell them is now\nStar Wars. <br><br>\nLike with Greek mythology, the memetic power of some stories and characters would\nhave greater effect and staying power than others. However, this isn\u2019t because the Pope of Memetics decrees it on Twitter\/X with memetic decrees from on high. No,\njust the outcome of the decentralised memetic forces and their ineffable movings.\n<\/p>\n\n<h3>But what about the price of the token? Who controls it?<\/h3>\nIf there is any truth to the idea of four-year cycles then we are currently at a midpoint.\nMaybe we launch the token and it goes to zero. Maybe it pumps and never comes\nback down. Maybe it pumps and retraces, and then stays in an accumulation zone\nfor a year before really taking off in the final phases of a bull run. Who knows? Not\nme. <br><br>\nPrice is just what follows, and is out of our hands. What then does lie within our\ngrasp? Our memetic capabilities and creative spark. Our ability to tap into the\nineffable forces of memes.<br><br>\nThe less we let temporary prices upset us, the more we resist the urge to look for a\nhandful of kings to make things happen, and thus the more we will focus on the\npower of tens of thousands of memelords working their magic. What we must\nmanifest is an unstoppable force in the XRPL that cannot be swayed by the\ntemporary glories or disasters of price. This idea must be instilled in our heads from\nthe beginning. When the time comes for the XRPL altseason, whenever that is, we\nmust be ready.<br><br>\nRemember what we accomplished in a short time at the end of the last bull run.\nThink what we can achieve with more time to build our network, more time to build\nmemetic lore, more time to have fun!<br><br>\nPlease see the tokenomics and airdrop paper at Moonboi589.com for full details.<br><br>\n\nOnly a small number of tokens is being kept back for the prime movers, with no one\nreceiving more than 1%. The majority will be available for those who set up a\ntrustline.<br><br>\n\n\n<strong>However, there will be a significant gift for those who do the most work to\nspread our decentralised memetics and create our powerful Decentralised\nMemetic Network.<\/strong><br><br>\n\nThis is not a payment for work, but as a gift for those that did the work. See the\ntokenomics & airdrop whitepaper. It will also be fully explained in future videos. <br><br>\n<h3>\u201cTick-Tock!\u201d<\/h3>\n<p>For those who wish to embark on this adventure with us we have one month to build\nthe foundations of an unstoppable memetic network. However, the airdrop won\u2019t be\nthe end, it will only be the true beginning. The task of spreading the memetic network\ncan ride as far and long as us Moonbois can take it.<\/p>\n<h3>Moonboi589 himself never dies. He only passes the torch.<\/h3>\n\n<p>By the end of the Big Bang Phase my time as the individual known as Moonboi589\nwill fade away. However, the spirit of Moonboi589 will not die as long as the spirit of\nmemetics lives on in MB589, XRP & the XRPL. <br><br>\nSome individual hubs of the Decentralised Memetic nNtwork will wax large in\nmemetic power or they may wane in memetic power. Individual influencers will rise\nand they will fall. Particular memes and lore will rise and they will fall. Price may rise\nand price may fall.<br><br>\nHowever, those holding the true spirit of Moonboi589 will not mind either way. If a\nTelegram community, or a Discord raid group, waxes in popularity then they may\ntake part, if it later wanes then so be it. This is in the hands of the ineffable memetic\nspirit. Each Moonboi remains their own individual node in the decentralised web\nregardless. Moonboi589 cannot die. Individual Moonbois can wax large or fade\naway.<br><br>\nOne Moonboi may never join groups, but remain content to simply meme as a lone\nwolf. Another may join a Telegram group, or follow a Youtube channel of their\nfavourite influencer in their first week and be happy with being solely part of that\nsingle hub forever.
